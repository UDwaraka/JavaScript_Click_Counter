# JavaScript_Click_Counter

Here i used some Basic Html and Css and also Some of the Javascript Events

The click() method simulates a mouse-click(on click event) on an element. This method can be used to execute a click on an element as if the user manually clicked on it.

1. Increment number variable value
Create a JavaScript variable and increment that variable when press a button

2. Decrement number variable value
Create a JavaScript variable and decrement that variable when press a button
